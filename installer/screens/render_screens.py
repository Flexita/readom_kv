# ask for one when they fail (initcheck/pw3-boot-report.rc), the entry's own
# stop() reboots after STOP_SECONDS (preinit/PreInit.c), and RescueParty takes
# the device through a restart rather than a wipe after five crashes (patch
# 0045). The screen says so while the start is running, because a failed start
# cannot be told anything afterwards (docs/design/diagnostics.md).
#
# "Usually", not "always": a freeze that crashes nothing and fails no check is
# not covered by any of the four, and RescueParty counts crashes. The sentence
# after this one in STUCK_* is what that case gets.
#
# "Books", not "books and data": the books are the Kindle's own, on its own
# store, and nothing here touches them. Android's settings are a different
# matter -- RescueParty's levels below the last one still reset them, which
# patch 0045 leaves alone on purpose, so promising the reader that no data
# changes is a promise this tree does not keep (a Codex review, 2026-10-30).

# What the reader is told about a start that is not working, on both screens
# that have to say it. It says what happens when a start fails, and counts
# nothing: "most failures" was a proportion this project has never measured,
# and the sentence does not need one to be useful.
#
# It is also narrower than what the website says about the same situation, and
# that is deliberate: do not "align" them by widening this one. The site says
# books and data are both kept, which is true -- patch 0045 replaced the only
# RescueParty level that wipes user data, and the three settings levels before
# it reset settings, which that patch's own description calls no cost to the
# reader. This screen says only the books because it has a line budget the site
# does not, and because AGAIN_ZH below already promises the app data in its own
# paragraph. Checked with the website session, 2026-10-30; recorded on both
# sides so that a future comparison of the two does not read this as the site
# having overclaimed.
#
# This screen used to carry a duration, and now carries none: it is drawn again
# after the handover and stands until Android's first frame, which on a plain
# boot is about three minutes and on the boot after an update is minutes for
# every installed app. One number is false in one of those two cases, and a
# reader who acts on the false one force-restarts a device that was working.
#
# What replaced it, until 2026-10-30, was worse than useless: "only a screen
# that flashes over and over means it could not start". A Codex review found
# the counterexample in this tree. PreInit.c stop() writes the reason into the
# report area and then sleeps STOP_SECONDS -- 120 of them -- before rebooting,
# and draws nothing: a start refused by the entry stands perfectly still for
# two minutes and then goes back on its own. Telling the reader that a still
# screen means it is working is a sentence this program can prove wrong.
#
# So neither a clock nor a symptom: what the reader needs is that waiting costs
# nothing and that there is a way back whenever they want one. The flashing is
# not named at all, because a reader who has to sort their symptom into two
# buckets has been given a job, and the answer is the same in both.
