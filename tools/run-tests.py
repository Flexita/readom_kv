"""Every test of this project that needs nothing but the machine it runs on.

The project's tests grew where the code did -- Python beside the tools, C
beside the headers it checks -- and each knew how to run itself and nobody
knew how to run them all. This is that list. It runs what can run here, says
what it skipped and why, and returns non-zero if anything failed, so that
"did I break something" is one command before a change is published.

The tests it does not run are the ones that need something this machine does
not have on its own: a kernel build to compare against, a built system image,
QEMU, or the device. They are listed as skipped with what each one wants, so
that the list is the whole truth and not the convenient part of it.
