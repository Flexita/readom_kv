# A module that stops being installed leaves its file in the staged tree, and
# the image carries it (V49: etc/init/wifi-events.rc, deleted from this project
# a day earlier, whose 25 init commands all failed at every boot). installclean
# is the supported answer, and nothing made anyone pass it.
#
# There is no list in the tree of what the product means to install, so this
# cannot be checked after the fact: out/target/product/pw3/installed-files.txt
# is made by walking the staged directory ($(FILESLIST) $(TARGET_OUT), core
# Makefile line 1370), so it describes what is there, stale files included.
# What can be checked is the cause: the makefiles that decide the package list
# are stamped after a build that cleared the staged tree, and a later build
# that finds them different and was not asked to clear it stops here rather
# than packaging whatever is left over.
#
# Two directories, hashed with their paths, over the copies this build will
# actually read:
#   - device/amazon/pw3, rsynced out of this repository by
#     prepare-aosp-device.sh;
#   - vendor/amazon/pw3-hardware, generated by prepare-kernel-hardware.sh. Its
#     pw3-usb-component.mk is inherited by pw3.mk (line 407) and its
#     PRODUCT_COPY_FILES decide which init files are installed, so changing
#     export_component.py's list changes the install set without touching a
#     single device makefile.
#
# Three things this had wrong, all of which let a stale file through:
#   - it hashed /mnt/port, the host tree, although the build reads the copy.
#     Nothing stops the host tree from being edited between the copy and this
#     line, so the stamp could describe a configuration this build never
#     staged, and the next build would then find it unchanged;
#   - it concatenated contents only, so renaming a makefile -- which is what
#     decides whether AOSP finds a module at all -- left the fingerprint
#     identical, as did adding an empty one;
#   - it missed the generated component above.
#
# What this still does not cover: a package list that changes because an
# inherited AOSP makefile changed. That happens with tools/sync-aosp.sh, which
# replaces the source tree, and the first build after it is against a tree this
# stamp does not describe either -- it is written only by a clearing build.
