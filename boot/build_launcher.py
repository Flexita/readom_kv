"""Build the Android entry for the Kindle library, in the build VM: one shell
script (launcher/launcher-template.sh) carrying a static helper, which carries
the handoff module, the kernel and the public initramfs. Nothing in it belongs

  --module         output of build_module.py for the same kernel, initramfs and command line
  --preinit-conf   pw3-preinit.conf without the device's fat_* and block= lines
  --data           data image (relative to the user FAT) and its size, for pw3-testdata.conf
  --installer      installer/build_payload.py output for the same system image: the entry
                   installs it first (installer/install/), from documents/ or downloaded
                   from --release-url/<payload name>; the system image must be
                   android/system.img and the data image android/data.img
  --screens        installer/screens/render_screens.py output for the same payload
  --system-image   the export's system.raw.img, the image that payload unpacks to: the
                   build that made it is read out of it (build_incremental in install.h)
  --ca-bundle      the CA bundle of source-lock.json "installer_ca_bundle", for the download

    Checked by the one shape such a URL has, rather than by the one mistake that
    was made. V65 shipped with the name given twice -- .../v65/NAME/NAME --
    because the full file URL was passed instead of the directory. Nothing
    noticed: the install being tested had the payload on the Kindle drive
    already, so the URL was never fetched, and it would have 404'd for the one
    person who needs it, the one who only downloads.

    The guard written then compared the last path segment to the file name and
    counted the name's occurrences, and both read the URL as undecoded text:
    `.../download/v67/android%2Dsystem%2Dv67.img.zst` does not match the name as
    written, so the name was appended to it a second time, and the tag *page*
    (`.../releases/tag/v67`) passed as well. Both 404, for the whole of this
    URL's audience.

    A wrong *version* in the URL needs no check of its own: the payload is
    admitted by its sha256 (install.h), so the wrong asset is refused rather than
    installed. That the asset is actually there is checked after the upload, by
    fetching it (docs/design/release-build.md); nothing at build time can.

    Two kinds of address are allowed, and the strictness differs because what is
    known about them differs (the owner's decision, 2026-10-30). github.com has
    a shape, and inside that shape are two traps that cost a release each -- the
    asset's own URL, and the tag page -- so an address there is held to the
    shape. Anywhere else there is no shape to hold it to: the entry carries one
    address and the route behind it is the project's own to arrange
    (docs/design/release-build.md, "下载线路"), so what is checked is what is
    true of any such address -- https, no query or fragment, nothing empty or
    `.`/`..` in the path, and the asset named exactly once once the name is
    appended. That last one is the V65 guard, and it is the one that catches an
    asset URL passed where a directory belongs, whatever the host.
