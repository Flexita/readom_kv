# pm.dexopt.shared is the filter for code another application loads, which
# cannot be compiled from a profile: that code is not public, and the other
# application could not read it. Go's value is "quicken", no compiled code at
# all, and it has to be set here: it is in build.prop, which init reads after
# the default.prop where AOSP's own "speed" is, and the later file wins for a
# property that is not read-only. A small application does not care (Settings,
# three cold starts each: 2614 ms with no compiled code against 2728 ms with
# it), a large one cannot run without it (WeRead: 129 s and "isn't responding",
# Test V32), and this value has to be the one that is safe for a large one.
# ro.logd.kernel: logd copies the kernel's ring into a buffer of its own when it

# lines, and must stay that size so that the stock kernel can read it back after
# a watchdog reset (config/android-core.config). logd's default is "on, unless

# Room a Java heap is given beyond what is live, i.e. how much an application
# allocates between two garbage collections. The Go defaults set none, which
# leaves ART's 2 MB, and as a low-RAM device nothing is added for the
# foreground application: Test V34, WeRead with 12 MB live collected its heap
# every 0.4 s, each collection 0.2-0.45 s on the one core it shares with the
# application ("NativeAlloc concurrent copying GC ... 11MB/13MB ... total
# 212ms", forty times in a row; the same 2 MB is the allowance for bitmap
# memory). A collection costs about 0.02 s per MB live here and a busy
# application allocates about 5 MB/s, so collecting takes a tenth of the time
# when the room is about as large as the live heap. With these values it is
# 2x the live heap, between 4 and 16 MB, for the application in use (the
# multiplier: ART adds 1 for its concurrent collector, making it 2) and half
# of that for the others. AOSP's 1 GB phone configuration allows 24 MB.
# An application is installed the way AOSP installs it, with "quicken" and no
# compiled code, and is compiled from its own usage profile once it has one.
# Two paired comparisons on WeRead 2.1.2 (13 dex, 70.4 MB of bytecode, the
# owner's own data left in place, the page cache dropped before every single
# start, nothing compiled inside the loop: every filter is put back by copying
# compiled code built beforehand). They were run at different times and so have
# their own baselines; the two cannot be put in one table.
#
#   speed against quicken, 6 rounds, the order alternating ABBA
#     speed 37.1 s, quicken 41.0 s
#     paired difference +3.9 s, SD 3.4, t = 2.77 (df 5), p = 0.04
#     95% confidence interval +0.3 to +7.5 s; one of the six rounds is negative
#     resident 206.9 MB against 183.6 MB
#
#   speed against speed-profile, 6 rounds
#     speed 34.7 s, speed-profile 36.6 s
#     paired difference +2.0 s, SD 4.0, t = 1.22 (df 5), p = 0.28
#     95% confidence interval -2.1 to +6.1 s; two of the six rounds are negative

#     speed 1214 s, 176 MB      speed-profile 159 s, 78 MB      quicken 60-93 s, 76 MB
#
# What this does and does not say. It does not say the three are equally fast:
# the interval for the profile reaches +6.1 s, and six rounds cannot rule that
# out. What it does say is that the cold start of this application is about
# 37 s whichever way it is compiled, that the most compiling can buy is a few
# seconds of it, and that it costs twenty minutes of a device nobody can use at
# the moment somebody taps install, plus 100 MB, plus 25 MB of a 511 MB machine.
# An earlier run of the first comparison said +9.9 s rather than +3.9 s. It was
# wrong by construction: it compiled "quicken" inside the loop, so every quicken
# start was measured directly after eighty seconds of dex2oat at full tilt, and
# every speed start after a file copy. Dropping the page cache does not undo
# what that leaves in zram and in free memory. Same device, same data, same
# week; only the design differs.
# The reason "speed" was set here was that WeRead with no compiled code took
# 129 s to its bookshelf and put up an "isn't responding" dialog (Test V32).
# That no longer reproduces: 41 s, no dialog. The likeliest explanation is Test
# V34, which gave the foreground application room between garbage collections
# (the heap values above) -- before it, WeRead collected its 12 MB heap every
# 0.4 s -- but that is a reading, not a measurement: nobody has run V32's
# filter against V34's heap settings on their own.
# The profile is written while the application runs and is compiled from by the
# idle job, which AOSP runs once a day while the device is idle and on a
# charger. On a Kindle that is rare, so most of the time an application stays
# at "quicken" and pm.dexopt.bg-dexopt below rarely does anything. Making that
# job reach a device off the charger was written and then withdrawn, and the
# reason is what is *not* measured: neither comparison above is quicken against
# speed-profile. Both are against "speed", taken in different sittings, so
# 3.9 - 2.0 is not a paired result and carries neither interval. What the
# withdrawal says is only that a patch to the scheduler -- with its wake-ups,
# its battery, and JobScheduler behaviour none of which was measured either --
# was not worth making for a difference nobody has measured. Measuring quicken
# against speed-profile, over a use rather than one cold start, is what would
# settle it.
# pm.dexopt.ab-ota is "speed-profile": it is what patch 0047 uses on the boot
# after a system update, when a new boot image makes every compiled file in
# /data invalid and all of it has to be made again. An application that has a
# reference profile by then is compiled from it, 159 s for WeRead; one that has
# not has its dex quickened, 60-93 s (frameworks/base patch 0051 and
# frameworks/native patch 0008). Until 2026-10-21 that second case compiled
# everything instead, 1214 s, which is twenty minutes of a device somebody has
# just updated and is waiting to use, for a start the measurements above put a
# few seconds apart.
# pm.dexopt.bg-dexopt is "speed-profile" because that job is the only thing that
# ever writes a reference profile: PackageDexOptimizer.isProfileUpdated() returns
# without calling mergeProfiles() unless the filter it is given compiles from a
# profile, and patch 0047 deliberately does not merge during boot. With "speed"
# there the current profile never becomes the reference one, every update falls
# back to compiling everything, and the numbers above are never collected.
# It does not ask installd for the fallback (0008) the way the boot does, and the
# reason written here until 2026-10-21 was the wrong one. It said the fallback
# would compile the applications the system came with in full -- 19 MB of /data,
# for applications three cold starts each say do not want it (Settings 2614 ms
# with no compiled code against 2728 ms with 8.4 MB of it, DocumentsUI 1855
# against 1937 ms) -- and that what they lose without it is the quickening. The
# first half stopped being true when the fallback became "quicken"; the second
# half was never true. A profile filter with no profile compiles no method but
# quickens the dex all the same: IsQuickeningCompilationEnabled is true for
# kSpeedProfile, and a method ShouldCompileBasedOnProfile turns down still reaches
# MarkForDexToDexCompilation (art/compiler/driver/compiler_driver.cc). These
# applications lose nothing by the fallback not being set here.
# What setting it would cost is the same work on every run of the job. dex2oat
# records the filter it was asked for and does not downgrade a profile filter when
# the profile is absent, so without the flag the odex says "speed-profile" and the
# next run of this job skips the application. With the flag it would say
# "quicken", which is never as good as the "speed-profile" this job asks for
# (IsAsGoodAs is current >= target over an enum where kQuicken precedes
# kSpeedProfile, art/runtime/compiler_filter.h and oat_file_assistant.cc), so
# every run would quicken every profile-less application again for an odex it
# already has. The boot does not have that problem: it happens once per update.
# Theirs are also the one kind of profile that can outlive the code it describes,
# since a system update replaces /system while /data keeps the profile.
# The Go default above would also take compiled code away again from an
# application left unused for ten days while storage is short; the value only
# moves that out of reach (the property cannot be unset from here, and 0 would
# mean "at once").
# 2026-10-28: bg-dexopt is "speed", not "speed-profile", and the paragraphs
# above about it writing the reference profile no longer describe what this
# product does. The reason is a measurement the owner asked for -- he said the
# device had not been this slow when he first used it -- and it is the one
# pw3.mk said above was missing: the install filter against "speed", over a use
# rather than one cold start. Same device, same account, same shelf of a dozen
# books, started by tapping the icon, A A B B A A with three minutes of settling
# after each compile: "speed-profile" four rounds at 99.8 / 88.9 / 104.8 / 89.0
# seconds, "speed" two rounds at 55.4 / 47.3, and 56 / 50 in two more rounds
# after compiling back. Wall 95.6 s against 51.4 s, process CPU 73.0 against
# 30.2, and the two groups do not overlap. Garbage collection barely moves
# (10.3-15.5 s against 8.0-11.5), so the 43 seconds are the cost of running
# bytecode in the interpreter. The six rounds above measured a cold start
# before signing in with an empty shelf: far less code, and most of what there
# is already in the profile. Loading a shelf and opening a book runs the EPub
# parser, the CSS parser and per-character typesetting, which the profile does
# not have, so they interpret from end to end. Same application, two workloads,
# opposite answers.
#
# What this gives up is the reference profile, which only a profile-guided
# filter writes. Nothing here needs it: "speed" compiles every method, and the
# app image that profile-guided compilation also brings was measured at about
# 0.4 s, inside the noise (docs/design/app-install.md). The runtime still writes
# the current profile, so the cheaper answer -- "speed-profile" against a
# profile that has actually matured -- can still be measured later; it never has
# been, because the job that would mature it has never run on this device.
#
# It does not touch what the image ships. Every application in it is compiled to
# "speed" (PRODUCT_DEX_PREOPT_DEFAULT_COMPILER_FILTER above), so IsAsGoodAs
# holds against this target too, getDexoptNeeded answers kNoDexOptNeeded, and
# nothing of the image is recompiled into /data/dalvik-cache. What changes is
# only the applications the owner installs.
#
# The cost is 99 MB of /data for WeRead (978 MB free) and about 23 MB resident,
# on a machine where low memory has killed the input method. That is why
# dalvik.vm.heapmaxfree and the foreground multiplier above are a question to
# settle together with this one, not separately.

# image's odex whenever the APK's directory is read-only -- without comparing
# the two filters (art/runtime/oat_file_assistant.cc, GetBestInfo). So a
# `quicken` application is recompiled into /data by the first dexopt pass with
# a better target, and that copy keeps running even once the image ships a
# better one: raising a module to `speed` does not change its dex, so the copy
# stays valid. Measured on the device under V59 (2026-10-20): Settings,
# DocumentsUI and PackageInstaller were all raised to `speed` and all three
# still ran V58's `speed-profile` copies out of /data -- 21 of the image's 31
# applications were running from /data, 14 MB of it, and the three that

#
# With `speed` as the default, CompilerFilterIsOkay's IsAsGoodAs holds against

# answers kNoDexOptNeeded, and nothing is ever written to /data/dalvik-cache
# for an application of this image. What the build decided is what runs, no
# application added later is quietly left out, and the device stops spending
# its one core recompiling what was already compiled. The knob is the one later
# AOSP adds for it (patches/aosp-build-make/0003).
#
# What it costs, measured by building it both ways rather than estimated
# (2026-10-20): every odex of the image read back with `oatdump --header-only`
# says `speed` (56 of them; the four system-server jars say `speed-profile`,
# which is go_defaults_common.mk's and a separate question), and the image went
# from 487,909,260 bytes with nine applications named to 493,832,076 with all
# of them: 5.9 MB, in a partition of 603,979,776 that is then still 105 MB
# empty. Against the `quicken` default the odex grows by 63.6 MB and the image
# by 21.5 MB, because a `speed` odex holds compiled code where a `quicken` vdex
# held quickened dex -- the odex total is 70.4 MB and the vdex 75.1 MB, which is
# 2.4 MB less than the same build at `quicken`.

# ro.hw_timeout_multiplier (frameworks/base patch 0012): the deadlines for
# "isn't responding" are 10 s for a broadcast and 5 s for a touch. A current
# application starting cold on this CPU keeps its main thread busy for longer
# than that without being hung: WeRead, fully compiled, needs 25-30 s to an
# idle bookshelf (Test V34), and whenever that crossed a full minute the clock
# broadcast ran into the 10 s and the dialog came up. 4 puts the broadcast
# deadline (40 s) beyond the whole start; a touch is given 20 s.
# No GPU: application windows use the software Canvas renderer instead of hwui
# on CPU-emulated GLES (frameworks/base patch 0006). debug.pw3.software_canvas
# overrides this at run time for newly started processes.
# ro.sf.disable_triple_buffer: Android 8.1's default "1" is read inverted
# (frameworks/native Layer.cpp: mProducer->setMaxDequeuedBufferCount(2) when
# set; BufferQueueCore's own default is one dequeued and one acquired buffer),
# so every window had three buffers; "0" gives each two. A full-screen buffer
# here is 1072x1448 RGBA, 6.2 MB. The third buffer only lets an application
# draw a frame further ahead of what the panel shows.
# ro.pw3.prefetch_recent_app: once boot has completed, the compiled code of the
# app used last is read into the page cache (frameworks/base 0025): the first
# start of WeRead after boot takes 13-16 s instead of 18-22 s.
# ro.logd.size: as a low-RAM device each log buffer would hold 64 KB, which
# boot alone overruns within minutes (Test V40), so a problem is gone from the
# log before anyone can look. 256 KB is Android's size for other devices; the
# buffers that fill (main, system, events, crash) then take about 1 MB more.
# ro.pw3.disable_display_transforms: the composer works on the CPU and neither
# scales nor applies a colour matrix, so magnification and colour inversion or
# correction would make SurfaceFlinger compose every frame with CPU-emulated
# GLES: more than 4 s of its CPU per frame magnified (Test V40.1). Settings does
# not offer them (Settings 0006).
# ro.pw3.hold_screen_past_deadline: true, and written here so that the list
# above says so. The window manager's default is the same (frameworks/base
# patches 0069-0073: when a transition's deadline passes with nothing drawn,
# the previous screen is kept until the new one draws); it was only ever in the
# Java until 2026-11-04 (open-items, "two small changes"), which is why a reader
# of this file could not see the feature was on. debug.pw3.hold_screen_past_deadline
# overrides it at run time.
# ro.pw3.disable_starting_window: false since 2026-11-03, true before that. The
# starting window costs another window -- 6 MB of fresh pages and a full-screen
# update of 134 ms or more -- and what it buys is that the reader sees what they
# tapped is starting: the system draws the target activity's own windowBackground
# from the package's resources, in a fraction of a second, without waiting for
# its process. For the application this device is for that background is a white
# page with the application's own black emblem on it (launch_style ->
# @drawable/launch_bg), which is also what e-paper draws best, and the
# application's own first frame is twenty to thirty seconds away. With this true
# the reader taps and nothing changes for that whole time (frameworks/base 0067
# and 0068; open-items row 16). debug.pw3.disable_starting_window overrides this
# on the device, so both ways can be looked at without a build.
