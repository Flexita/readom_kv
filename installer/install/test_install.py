    `PW3_TEST_UNREADABLE` makes lstat fail with EIO for one named path. The
    installer has to tell "the store says there is no image" from "the store
    could not say", because it makes a new data image for the first and that
    would write over everything the user has read. No filesystem here can be
    made to fail lstat on one file while open still works, so the failure is
    injected around the real call instead of in the installer.

    `PW3_TEST_UNOPENABLE` makes open and fopen fail with EIO for one named path,
    while everything else about it -- its size, its contents -- stays as it is.
    That is the one way the installer can be shown the difference between "this
    file says X" and "I was not allowed to read this file", and both answers it
    used to give were wrong: a payload it could not open was deleted as a bad one
    (installer/unpack/unpack.c), and a state file it could not open was taken for
    there being no state file (read_state).

    `PW3_TEST_UNDELETABLE` makes unlink fail with EROFS for one named path, so
    that the installer can be caught saying a file was deleted when it was not.

    `PW3_TEST_FAIL_NTH` is `call:path:n`, and fails the nth call of `call` on
    `path` while every call before it goes through. Failing from the first call,
    which is all the switches above can do, never reaches the branches that come
    after a successful open: the `fstat` of the input, the *second* open of it in
    pw3_unpack, and a read that stops part way. Those were the three places the
    review of 2026-10-21 could not reach, and the three that classified an
    operation failure as a damaged package and deleted it.

    `PW3_TEST_FREE_BYTES` makes the store report that much free space. A store
    down to its last kilobytes is what the report area has to give way to, and
    filling a real filesystem to prove it would take as long as the store is
    large.
